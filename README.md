# Effort and Cost Estimation in Agile Software Development
## B.Tech Project

While we came across learning  the traditional models in software development , the conclusion or verdict while following an software engineering model  approach is dependent on its phases followed/involved during the process as a whole; although further advancement/optimisations to these phases is also achievable .
Willingly the theory for such models involving phases as a part of traditional software development is to accomplish the project within time , within budget without compromising the quality. Although for such instances further optimisation(s) were sometimes case specific, need may vary case to case.
